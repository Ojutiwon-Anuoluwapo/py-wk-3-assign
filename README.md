## Installation

No special installation is required. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

You can run the script directly from the command line or within an IDE.

## Usage

Run the script, and you will be prompted to enter the original price and discount percentage. The program will then display the final price after applying the discount if eligible.

Example:

Enter the original price of the item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Discount applied. Final price is: $75.00

text

If the discount is below 20%, the program will keep the original price:

Enter the original price of the item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 15
No discount applied. Price remains: $100.00

text
